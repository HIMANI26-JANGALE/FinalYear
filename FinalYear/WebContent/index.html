                <h1>ABOUT PROJECT</h1>
                <p>Big data analytics and processing are techniques used to analyse data and
                    to extract hidden information. Traditional approaches to analysis and
                    extraction don't work well for large data because this data is complex
                    and of very high volume. A major processing technique mentioned as data
                    clustering, groups the data into clusters and makes it easy to extract
                    information from these clusters.Clustering is the powerful tool which has
                    been used in many applications. Under this topic, a generic methodology for
                    weather forecasting is proposed with the help of a clustering algorithm.
                    In this topic, weather forecasting is done by using the incremental air
                    pollution database. Upcoming day's data will be predicted by using incremental
                    strategy. This forecasting database is totally based on the impacts of air pollution,
                    launch focused modelling computations for prediction and forecasts of further weather
                    events. In this project we are going to compare different clustering algorithms
                    on the basis of different parameters and going to implement weather forecasting
                    using an efficient clustering algorithm.
